### ‚ùì what is get_next_line
The aim of get_next_line is very basic. It is to create a function that retrieves the next line of a file. Whenever the function is called, the next line should be retreived, until it reaches the end of the file

### üìñ concepts
Fds, opening files, reading, static variables

### my experience
From evaluating other cadet's get_next_line, I've noticed the solution typically follows a similmiar algorithm, without much deviation. The project throws some basic rules and requirements that must be followed, such as requiring n number of bytes to be read from read(), and being unable to back-track and re-read from another point of the file. After figuring out the algorithm myself, I was in awe at how resourceful and efficient this it was at reading a file's contents.
